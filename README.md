## The "Staging" Website

The "staging" website is an alternate version of the website including changes in development.

You can find it at : **staging • koohii • com**

*VERY IMPORTANT: it is connected to the live database, meaning you login with your same credentials, any changes happen to your real account.*

## Contributing Feedback

Both **issues and suggestions** can be posted in the Issues tab. Just click [New issue](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/issues/new) and voila!

Consider **Watching** this repository (dropdown at the top of the screen) if you want to see what's going on, what changes on staging, and follow up on discussions.

**NEXT ITEMS**: [issues I'm working on next](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ANEXT) are labelled `NEXT`.

**DISCUSSIONS**: [issues labelled discussion](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Adiscussion%20) are opened indefinitely and are less focused. They are intended to brainstorm fixes or features. Any concrete steps that come out of it will be added as separate issues.

## Other Ways to Contribute

The website is not in a state for publishing fully on Github. See [Open Source Status](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/wiki/Open-Source-Status).

**Code**: I am looking at ways to accept contributions via components. For example if I author a Vue JS component I could create a separate repo for that, so I can both share re-usable parts and accept improvements for the website. In that way I can expose just parts that are more up to date, and don't have to worry too much about all the legacy code I have to manage.

**Design**: the [design/PSDs folder](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/tree/master/design/PSDs)  contains resources that you can use if you want to contribute alternative better designs. Ask me if I can add something there.

**Content**: the outdated documentation page of the website is also a good example of content that could be community maintained (as a Markdown file that I can include in the site build). I'll figure out things like that as I get to grips with Github.
