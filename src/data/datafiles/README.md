## data/datafiles/download

Files that downloaded from various sources and saved in the `download` subfolder. These files tend to be very large (JMDICT, KANJIDIC, etc) so they are not included in the public repository.

If you need any of these files to run a script from the data/scripts/ folder, then download the file from the URL listed below, and name it as in the list below.
