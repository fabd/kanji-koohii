        RTK Editions Compared.ods
          Originally by Chris aka Katsuo from the now retired RevTK Forums.
          
          The spreadsheet was updated for Kanji Koohii parsing with:
            - lesson 57 (RTK Volume 3)
            - lesson 58 (Newly Approved General-Use Kanji #3008-3030 for Old Ed. RTK1)
            - Old Edition lesson numbers (merged in from Ziggr's Heisig Kanji Index)

        RTK Editions Compared.csv
          This is the .ods file exported to .csv:
          - remove rows 1-2
          - remove cols A I J K L
          - Save as `.csv` with tab delimiters

        table_kanjis.csv
          Data file to be SOURCEÂ´d straight into the Kanji Koohii database.
          Generated by data/scripts/kanjis_table.php (see the documentaton there).


## data/datafiles/download

Files that downloaded from various sources and saved in the `download` subfolder. These files tend to be very large (JMDICT, KANJIDIC, etc) so they are not included in the public repository.

If you need any of these files to run a script from the data/scripts/ folder, then download the file from the URL listed below, and name it as in the list below.
